	<h2>About Anderson</h2>
    <p>Judge Cassandra Anderson is a member of the PSI Division of the Justice department of Mega-City One. Like her namesake from antique myth, she has psychic powers. In additions to being able to sense approaching danger and foresee events of the near future, she is also telepathic. This allows her to read other people's minds and use mental attacks.</p>
